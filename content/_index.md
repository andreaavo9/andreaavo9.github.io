I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Verona, supervised by Prof. Marco Cristani. My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I am currently working on time series forecasting, human pose forecasting, and language generation. I am passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems. I believe that machine learning has the potential to make a positive impact on the world, and I am excited to be a part of this field.

 In my spare time, I enjoy biking, working out and spending time with my family. I also like to cook and building DIY stuff in my parents home garage! I'm a big fan of commercial and EDM music, videogames and tv series. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me.
